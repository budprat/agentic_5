2. Set up Support Commander orchestrator
3. Implement basic routing logic
4. Create agent communication protocols

### Phase 2: Specialist Agents (Week 2)
1. Implement each specialist agent
2. Create agent cards for registration
3. Set up MCP tool integrations
4. Implement streaming responses

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (Week 3)
1. Add ML models for sentiment analysis
2. Implement context management
3. Create escalation algorithms
4. Build knowledge base integration

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Week 4)
1. Comprehensive testing suite
2. Performance optimization
3. Security hardening
4. Documentation

## Database Schema (Supabase)

```sql
-- Support tickets
CREATE TABLE support_tickets (
    ticket_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id TEXT,
    status TEXT,
    priority INTEGER,
    sentiment_score FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP,
    agent_assignments JSONB,
    conversation_history JSONB
);

-- Customer profiles
CREATE TABLE customer_profiles (
    customer_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    satisfaction_score FLOAT,
    interaction_count INTEGER,
    preferred_language TEXT,
    product_versions JSONB,
    support_history JSONB
);

-- Knowledge base
CREATE TABLE knowledge_articles (
    article_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    category TEXT,
    tags TEXT[],
    content TEXT,
    usage_count INTEGER,
    effectiveness_score FLOAT
);

-- Analytics
CREATE TABLE support_analytics (
    metric_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    metric_type TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    value JSONB
);
```

## Success Metrics
- Average resolution time < 5 minutes
- Customer satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- First-contact resolution rate > 80%
- Escalation rate < 10%
- Multi-language accuracy > 95%

## Unique Value Propositions
1. **Emotion-Aware Support**: Adjusts tone based on customer sentiment
2. **Predictive Resolution**: Suggests solutions before issues escalate
3. **Continuous Learning**: Improves from every interaction
4. **Omnichannel Unity**: Seamless experience across all channels
5. **Proactive Engagement**: Reaches out before problems occur

This implementation will showcase the A2A-MCP framework's versatility in a customer-facing application, demonstrating how the same patterns used for Market Oracle can be applied to entirely different domains.
