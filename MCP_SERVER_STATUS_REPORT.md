## Overall Assessment

**9/10 servers confirmed working** with active processes. Snowflake is configured but may need initialization. The system has excellent redundancy with multiple web scraping options (BrightData, Firecrawl, Jina) and browser automation tools (Puppeteer, Playwright).

## Recommendations

1. **Snowflake**: Verify database credentials and connection settings if SQL queries are needed
2. **Monitoring**: All other services are running and should be monitored for health
3. **Redundancy**: Multiple similar services provide good failover options

## Process Count Summary
- Total MCP-related processes: 25+
- Primary configured servers running: 9/10
- Additional services detected: 4
