   - Identified 10 primary MCP servers in configuration
   - Found 25+ MCP-related processes running

2. **Created Test Infrastructure**
   - Built `test_mcp_servers.py` script for future automated testing
   - Documented test approach for each server type

3. **Generated Status Report**
   - Created `MCP_SERVER_STATUS_REPORT.md` with detailed findings
