        "text": "Just visited the newly upgraded Yorktown IMAX in IL, officially the first Laser projector at an AMC in Chicago. Picture quality was amazing, insanely better than all the other offerings in the nearby area, very sharp and seemed well calibrated. Sound was amazing, I read some people say it wasn\u2019t upgraded, but it definitely seemed like a huge improvement, when asking the employees they confirmed it was upgraded along with the projector but weren\u2019t sure if it got the 12-channel or 6-channel audio. The projector only had one lens so it does seem to be an XT Single Laser. Best seats I\u2019ve had in an AMC here though! Highly recommend for all A-Listers",

Fishing rods, cars, houses, I can build any yt house you want. IM LOOKING FOR NEONS AND MEGAS. Maybe even mid tiers depending on the cash traded. Im using the elve value. 1k = 1 elve point. If you want a house built, the cost of the actual house goes into it. OKAY THANK YOU FOR READING! (I offer to copy yt speed builds because its just easier. Someone can get exactly what they want.. I have started to realize that people offer really bad for houses you make on your own.. obviously if I were to post them, all credit goes to the creators!)",
