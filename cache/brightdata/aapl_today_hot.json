        "text": "I am pretty sure that a lot of AAPL shareholders are frustrated about the current performance. NVDA, MSFT, and META are heading to ATH. Even the meme TSLA outperforms rotten AAPL. AMZN is doing better job than AAPL on the market. AI In my opinion, AI is overrated. The market wants to see more AI-related news from AAPL. However, AAPL has no in-house LLMs. LLMs are cloud-based commodities, which will be run at marginal cost. Since Deepseek, we know that open source-based LLMs are just commodities and have no MOAT. There has been a rumor that AAPL might buy Perplexity. But Perplexity relies on GUI system and no in-house LLMs. Perplexity as a GUI system based company orchestrates ChatGPT, Claude, Antrophic, and Gemini to provide results out of that. There is no MOAT. It would be a failed M&A for AAPL if AAPL acquires Perplexity. Perplexity has no traction, because this company is not even in TOP 100 at App Store. When we get the news that even META tried to talk to Perplexity for a possible M&A, I highly assumes that Perplexity offers themselves, because: Perplexity knows that they can\u00b4t survive as a stand alone company sooner or later. the bankers want to drive the market value of Perplexity up. AAPL is lagging behind in AI, but AAPL can power their competitive advantages with their powerful eco-system (iOS). AAPL needs to figure out how to provide a solid feature to users. Siri must be more intelligent. As AAPL has doomed Siri for over 10 years and has presented their future direction with Siri already at WWDC 2024, the time is ticking that AAPL needs to deliver their promise. Tariffs It is not AAPL\u00b4s fault, but AAPL has been very timid. AAPL has moved their production for the US market from China to India. However, Trump dissed Tim Cook that he does not like their re-location from China to India. Instead of that, Trump would like to see AAPL move from China to the US. Since then, Tim Cook has been silent. It gives a clear contradiction from Jensen Huang from Nvidia reacted when his super computer H-20 is banned for China. Jensen Huang immediately responded to this action and has been on trips world wide to cover the potential loss from China. He was very pro-active to Trump to keep Nvdia\u00b4s stock performance. But Tim Cook has been very timid so far and does not really show his pro-active move to negotiate with Trump. While other CEOs are chasing AI-startups and talents, Tim Cook rather hangs out with Hollywood stars for premier F1. Tariffs will affect AAPL negatively. If Tariffs will drive their sales down, we will see in the upcoming Q2, Q3 and Q4. Slow innovation People claim that AAPL has lost their innovative mindset. However, the innovation has never been the reason for their success. iPhone was not the first smartphone. The reason for their success is that AAPL has provided the most optimized solution for user-friendly device. I can\u00b4t imagine to type blackberry or Nokia things. Additionally, Sony, which introduced the first concept of a smartphone, could not provide a seamless solution for their concept, because Sony was so behind in Software and eco-system based infrastructure. AAPL could master a seamless and user-friendly device with their own iOS eco-system, which just works. \"It works\" principle has been the reason for their success. However, AAPL is very slow to bring out some HW-related features. Their foldable phone will be launched next year although Samsung has been on the foldable market for 7 years already. There is also a rumor that AAPL can\u00b4t achieve their original design (All Glass) for 20th anniversary. AAPL needs to justify why people should upgrade their phones. But until now, AAPL has failed to provide a proper solution for that. People still buy iPhones, but their growth rate is just under 5% at PE (FWD) 26x. What can drive AAPL up? Simple. Tim Cook needs to deliver \"way better than expected\" Q2 to get back to where AAPL was at the end of last year. Additionally, Tim Cook needs to deliver a promising forecast even if AAPL does not give any forecasts, but Tim Cook needs to let Wall Street know that AAPL is quite confident to beat the market. AAPL needs to promote more about their healthcare-driven strategy. I strongly believe that AAPL is heavily and serioulsy interested in healthcare sector. But AAPL has been very timid and had some lawsuits with other companies for patents at Apple Watch. Read more",
