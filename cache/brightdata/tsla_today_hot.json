        "title": "$60K on TSLA Puts:  Why TSLA Will Be Down Big Next Few Weeks.",
        "text": "In no particular order: Iran news completely overshadows the Robotaxi launch which was likely a sell-the-news event anyways. Weekend fake internet money prices point to a selloff in stocks. TSLA highly correlated to fake internet money. TX senate vote and signature of Governor requiring all autonomous vehicles to get to Level autonomy in order to operate starting in September. This is a huge precedent which now means TSLA robotaxis will take much longer to scale because each State will have its own autonomous driving thresholds and review periods. Waymo will continue to expand faster than TSLA. Attention now shifts to July 22 earnings. Sales are pretty much down YoY throughout most of the entire world. Analyst downgrades are coming. TSLA will likely lower full year guidance. I expect a class action lawsuit from disgruntled HW3 owners soon because they are all realizing Elon lied about HW3 getting a free upgrade to HW4 and beyond. It is clear now that HW3 vehicles wont ever have true FSD and the legal liability will be in the tens of billions of dollars. Elon is still popping off about one of Mango\u2019s closest White House aides. The probability of Elon pissing off Mango again is not insignificant. $7,500 EV Tax Credit likely expires at the end of this year. Oil spike likely means Fed delays rate cuts further. High P/E stocks like TSLA generally suffer more in higher rate environments especially if economic growth is also slowing.",

        "text": "TSLA sliding today, and it looks like Europe might be a big reason. That\u2019s 5 months in a row of declining sales over there, even though overall EV demand in the region is still growing Not great timing when we\u2019re heading into Q2 delivery numbers Wells Fargo already warned they expect a big miss. Market seems to be pricing that in early I\u2019m long TSLA but can\u2019t ignore the red flags: Brand perception in Europe is taking a hit BYD pulling back production in China too is it EV demand or just Tesla? Still holding for now but feeling less confident about the near term Anyone trimming positions or rotating out ahead of the Q2 report?",
