        "text": "Data always tells a story. All you have to do is look. [ Prologue ] CAT Error data came out today with Expensive Two et al. immediately noticing 7.3 BILLION CAT Errors on June 17, the same day GameStop completed their $2.25 BILLION Convertible Note Offering [ SuperStonk ]. To understand what happened, we must look backward... specifically, back C35 which would be May 13. On May 13, there was a lot of XRT creation [ X ], and ETF borrowing went through the roof [ X ]; which altogether signals something was going on behind the scenes. To figure out what, we look backwards again by C35 which was 4/7. On April 7, Ryan Cohen filed a Form 4 indicating he took DIRECT Ownership of his 37M shares [ SEC , SuperStonk where RC's shares were previously indirectly owned ]. Timeline On April 7, Ryan Cohen filed a Form 4 indicating he took DIRECT Ownership of his 37M shares. C35 later on May 13 ETF activity on ETFs known to have relevance to GME (e.g., XRT) went nuts. Keep in mind that we have \"Confirmation of T+35 Failures-To-Deliver Cycles: Evidence from GameStop Corp.\" from Mendel University in Brno [ PDF , SuperStonk ] which says the longest possible ETF can kick is 35 calendar days (i.e., C35 aka T+35). C35 later on June 17 there were 7.3 BILLION CAT Errors and GameStop completed their $2.25 BILLION Convertible Note Offering. Which means... GameStop picked up $2.25 billion interest free \"loan\" from qualified institutional buyers because Ryan Cohen took his direct ownership (e.g., DRS) of his 37M GME shares. GameStop can now deploy that capital in whatever way they see fit for the benefit of GameStop. Remember: Ryan Cohen takes no compensation from GameStop so his interests are aligned with all shareholders. DIRECT REGISTER YOUR SHARES FOR DIRECT OWNERSHIP! Also... it should be pretty clear now that the $2.25 billion interest free \"loan\" is basically an \"exit\" for qualified institutional buyers (*cough* GME shorts *cough*) who have decided to flip sides. The exit fee is a large interest free \"loan\" to GameStop which raises the stock price floor benefitting all shareholders . You may recall a lot of discussion about arbitraging the Convertible Notes [ SuperStonk ]. Arbitraging a Note is not an exit for Note holder out because they would've shorted the shares already today while the Notes may or may not actually provide shares tomorrow (i.e., at conversion). Remember, a key feature overlooked by many is that GameStop decides at its election whether the conversion is by cash and/or shares (i.e., cash only, shares only, or cash + shares) . Upon conversion, GameStop will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of GameStop\u2019s Class A common stock, par value $.001 per share (\u201cClass A common stock\u201d), or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at its election . [ Press Release ] If a Note holder arbitrages their Notes by short selling the shares today, any shares tomorrow only cover the shares arbitraged today. A GME short seller arbitraging the Notes is doubling down on the short; not taking the exit. A GME short selling Note holder can only exit their short position with these Notes if they do not arbitrage and short sell shares; while giving GameStop an interest free \"loan\" . (Plus, GameStop can elect to screw a GME short selling Note holder upon conversion by returning inflation-devalued cash instead of shares; where the short seller will have dug themselves in deeper by arbitraging the Note today short selling GME shares leaving them with a larger short position and giving GameStop interest free money. All while the stock price rises because other short sellers have flipped and want out.) GME short sellers wanting to exit must trust GameStop and Ryan Cohen to convert their Notes into shares -- The Ultimate Trust Me Bro. Ryan Cohen & GameStop, IN BRO I TRUST! I LIKE THE STOCK!
