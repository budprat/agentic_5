# INITIAL.md - Google ADK Multi-Agent System Implementation

## FEATURE:

- Google ADK-based multi-agent system with hierarchical agent orchestration across 3 tiers
- Tier 1: Master Orchestrators using Sequential, Parallel, and Loop patterns for complex workflows
- Tier 2: Domain Specialists with structured outputs using Pydantic models for financial, technical, and healthcare analysis
- Tier 3: Service Agents with MCP tool integration for data processing, API integration, and computation
- Complete investment analysis system demonstrating all tiers working together
- A2A protocol integration for inter-agent communication
- Quality validation framework with domain-specific thresholds
- Advanced orchestration patterns: Hybrid (Sequential+Parallel+Loop), Dynamic Routing, and Adaptive Workflows

## EXAMPLES:

In the `agent-development-kit-crash-course` folder, there is a comprehensive set of examples demonstrating Google ADK integration.

And some agents in folder src/a2a_mcp/agents/adk_examples/ as per the A2A MCP framework like below
- `tier1_sequential_orchestrator.py` - ContentCreationOrchestrator showing sequential workflow with state management
- `tier2_domain_specialist.py` - Domain specialists (Financial, Technical, Healthcare) with structured Pydantic outputs
- `tier3_service_agent.py` - Service agents with MCP and custom tool integration
- `advanced_orchestration_patterns.py` - Hybrid, Dynamic Routing, and Adaptive workflow patterns
- `complete_system_example.py` - Full investment analysis system using all three tiers
- `README.md` - Comprehensive guide to all examples and patterns

Key patterns demonstrated:
- Using Google ADK's 5 agent types: Agent, LlmAgent, SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, LoopAgent
- Tool integration
- Sub-agent delegation using AgentTool wrapper
- Callbacks for monitoring and state management
- Integration with A2A framework's StandardizedAgentBase

## DOCUMENTATION:

- Google ADK Official Documentation https://google.github.io/adk-docs/
- Google ADK Implementation Plan: `GOOGLE_ADK_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- A2A Framework Documentation: `A2A_MCP_ORACLE_FRAMEWORK.md`
- Architecture Guide: `ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md`
- Multi-Agent Workflow Guide: `MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`
- ADK Crash Course Examples: `agent-development-kit-crash-course/`
- Gemini Models Reference: `agent-development-kit-crash-course/GEMINI_MODELS.md`

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- **Environment Setup**: 
  - Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in environment variables
  - Configure MCP server URL for tool integration
  - Set up A2A protocol ports for inter-agent communication

- **Model Selection**:
  - Tier 1 Orchestrators: `gemini-2.5-pro`
  - Tier 2 Specialists: `gemini-2.5-pro`
  - Tier 3 Services: `gemini-2.5-pro`

- **Project Structure**:
  ```

  ```

- **Key Implementation Notes**:
  - All ADK agents inherit from `StandardizedAgentBase` for A2A compatibility
  - Quality validation is configurable per domain (BUSINESS, ACADEMIC, SERVICE)
  - MCP tools are loaded dynamically via `MCPToolset`
  - A2A protocol enables cross-agent communication on different ports
  - Callbacks enable monitoring and state management between agent stages
  - Use python_dotenv and load_env() for environment variables
  - agent-development-kit-crash-course/ - read through all of the files and folders here to understand best practices for creating Google ADK AI agents that support different providers and LLMs, handling agent dependencies, and adding tools to the agent.
Don't copy any of these examples directly, it is for a different project entirely. But use this as inspiration and for best practices.

- **Testing**:
  - Unit tests for each agent type
  - Integration tests for multi-agent workflows
  - Performance tests for parallel execution
  - See testing strategy in implementation plan

- **Deployment**:
  - Docker compose configuration for multi-agent deployment
  - Kubernetes manifests for production scaling
  - Environment-based configuration management
  - See deployment guidelines in implementation plan
