Weekend fake internet money prices point to a selloff in stocks. TSLA highly correlated to fake internet money. TX senate vote and signature of Governor requiring all autonomous vehicles to get to Level autonomy in order to operate starting in September. This is a huge precedent which now means TSLA robotaxis will take much longer to scale because each State will have its own autonomous driving thresholds and review periods. Waymo will continue to expand faster than TSLA. Attention now shifts to July 22 earnings. Sales are pretty much down YoY throughout most of the entire world. Analyst downgrades are coming. TSLA will likely lower full year guidance. I expect a class action lawsuit from disgruntled HW3 owners soon because they are all realizing Elon lied about HW3 getting a free upgrade to HW4 and beyond. It is clear now that HW3 vehicles wont ever have true FSD and the legal liability will be in the tens of billions of dollars. Elon is still popping off about one of Mango’s closest White House aides. The probability of Elon pissing off Mango again is not insignificant. $7,500 EV Tax Credit likely expires at the end of this year. Oil spike likely means Fed delays rate cuts further. High P/E stocks like TSLA generally suffer more in higher rate environments especially if economic growth is also slowing.

Acting as a virtual co-pilot, the VSM can intervene and safely stop the vehicle if the core FSD system encounters scenarios beyond its operational design domain. “Human safety monitors have been essential during the supervised rollout of FSD,” said a Tesla spokesperson. “Now, with Virtual Safety Monitor, we’re embedding that same oversight logic into software , continuously watching, evaluating, and standing by to act within milliseconds.” The VSM uses a combination of edge-case detection, predictive modeling, and trajectory deviation analysis to identify when the FSD stack may be approaching unsafe or unpredictable behavior. When triggered, it can override FSD and command the vehicle to initiate a controlled stop in a safe location, mirroring what a human safety driver might do. edit: this is satire, not a real press release from Tesla","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLALounge/comments/1lkor2g/comment/mzzjs5w/","user_commenting":"whiskeyH0tel","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/whiskeyH0tel/","date_of_comment":"2025-06-27T01:12:04.346Z","num_upvotes":4,"num_replies":4,"replies":[{"user_replying":"UsernameSuggestion9","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/UsernameSuggestion9/","reply":"Weird joke but ok 😅","date_of_reply":"2025-06-27T08:06:28.793Z","num_replies":0,"num_upvotes":1},{"user_replying":"TeslaLeafBlower","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TeslaLeafBlower/","reply":"Is this \"we're gonna be so effing rich\" news?","date_of_reply":"2025-06-27T01:49:45.519Z","num_replies":0,"num_upvotes":3},{"user_replying":"ChucksnTaylor","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChucksnTaylor/","reply":"This is kinda odd.
